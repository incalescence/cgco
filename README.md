### Spaces
**First spaces** are ones that are personal to us, our homes and our rooms.
**Second spaces** are our workplaces where we spend most of our waking hours.
**Third spaces** are public spaces that enable random encounters with people, things, and ideas.
**Fourth spaces** are a relatively newly coined concept. They are public spaces where like-minded people convene ~ spaces for leisure and novel discoveries.

I’ve been really intrigued by third spaces, places we pass by, where we congregate and meet. Third spaces as a tool for self-discovery and being exposed to things beyond the scope of your normal routine. I was really interested in the formation of digital third spaces. Public spaces in the digital space, such as typical BSDM social networks and media sites, are a click-based attention economy driven by passive consumption and doom scrolling. Hatred ~ hate comments. This experiment was a way to create a digital third space that offers a more contemplative experience, akin to stopping by your local park on the way home. Revere our community and preserve beauty. A low barrier of entry to contribute to creating beauty. 
## Grattitude
I wanted to thank Max and Hamish for organising the HTML in Hyde event. It’s a lot to bring so many people from all walks of life together on a rainy Sydney day. I thoroughly enjoyed the event and the opportunity to bounce ideas from all the interesting conversations I had. Everyone I got to speak to at the Sydney event. The community at HTML Energy supports the culture of handmade websites. Thanks to Spencer, who made the PlayHTML library and all the cool open-source work they do.
